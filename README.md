# Attendance_system_using_C_Programming
Hello! I am a BIT student at Padmashree International College, Kathmandu, Nepal. During my first semester, I noticed the problem of manual attendance tracking for our classes, so I decided to create a simple solution using C programming. In general, it automates attendance recording, increases accuracy, saves time and reduces paperwork.  05-11-2024
