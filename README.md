# Attendance_system_using_C_Programming
During my first semester at college, I developed an innovative attendance system utilizing the C programming language. This project emerged as a solution to the challenges posed by manual attendance tracking systems. By automating the attendance recording process, the program not only ensures accuracy but also significantly reduces the time and effort required for administrative tasks. Additionally, it minimizes paperwork, promoting a more eco-friendly and efficient approach to managing student attendance data.  05-11-2024
